                        95% of Russians dream of going somewhere, but only 36% plan to spend their holidays in their native country. Like, what have we not seen here at home? In fact, Russia is a whole universe with the gentle sea of ​​the south, the dense forests of the Sayans and the harsh ice of the Putorana Plateau. 
                        And you can also see all these beauties without millions in your account, a passport and many hours of flights. Like, for example, Vera Bashmakova, a brave young mother who grabbed her three children, 
                        put them in her Lada and drove 20 thousand kilometers across her native country. We have selected and described some interesting places worthy of your vacation.

                                Altai is one of the most beautiful places in Russia. First of all, because of the mountains: if you drive along the ridge, you will see slopes strewn with pine trees, mountain rivers and lakes. And if you open the windows in your car, you can
                                get acquainted with the invisible miracle of these places - mountain air.

                                The climate in Altai is temperate, so it is best to go here in summer. So you will see all the variety of local flora and fauna. Moose roam the forests of Altai, eagles fly over the ridges, and roe deer graze on the plains. And
                                famous manuls are also inhabitants of the Altai Territory.

                                ice. In March 2019, at the Baikal Mile festival, a world record was set - 197.011 km/h.
